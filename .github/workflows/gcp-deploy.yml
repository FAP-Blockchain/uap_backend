# This workflow triggers Cloud Build using cloudbuild.yaml (already in repo).
# Required GitHub Secrets (recommended: Workload Identity Federation):
# - GCP_WIF_PROVIDER: Workload identity provider resource name
#   e.g. projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL/providers/PROVIDER
# - GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: Service account email used by GitHub Actions
#   e.g. gha-deployer@uap-blockchain.iam.gserviceaccount.com
#
# The service account needs (at minimum):
# - roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor (or builds.builder + permissions)
# - roles/run.admin
# - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser (on the runtime/deploy SA if applicable)
# - roles/artifactregistry.writer
#
# Optional: if you prefer JSON key auth (NOT recommended), you can switch auth step.
